## Appendix C – Universal Declaration Framework

The event emission pattern established by `λTrust` extends to a universal framework for declaring any concept into digital existence. This framework uses minimal smart contracts to emit concept events, creating reality through declaration.

### Universal Pattern

```solidity
event Concept(address indexed from, address indexed to, bytes data);

function declare(address to, bytes calldata data) external {
emit Concept(msg.sender, to, data);
}
